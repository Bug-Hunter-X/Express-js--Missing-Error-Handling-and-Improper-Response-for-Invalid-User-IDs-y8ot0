# Express.js Bug: Missing Error Handling and Improper Responses

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input and sending empty responses instead of proper error messages.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks error handling for cases where the user ID is not a valid number or when a user with the specified ID is not found.  Instead of returning a meaningful error response, it sends an empty JSON object, which makes debugging difficult and can lead to unexpected client-side behavior.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.js` addresses these issues by:

1.  Adding input validation to ensure the user ID is a number.
2.  Implementing proper error handling using appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests and 404 for not found).
3.  Returning informative error messages to the client.

This improved error handling makes the API more robust and easier to debug.
